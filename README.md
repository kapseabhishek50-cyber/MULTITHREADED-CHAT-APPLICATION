DUAL-MODE EXECUTION:
THE PROGRAM UTILIZES COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS TO TOGGLE BETWEEN SERVER AND CLIENT ROLES. IF THE ARGUMENT "SERVER" IS DETECTED, IT INITIALIZES THE NETWORK HUB; OTHERWISE, IT LAUNCHES AS A USER TERMINAL.
SERVER-SIDE MULTITHREADING:
THE SERVER EMPLOYS THE EXECUTORSERVICE (VIA EXECUTORS.NEWCACHEDTHREADPOOL()). IN 2026, THIS IS THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR MANAGING CONCURRENCY AS IT AUTOMATICALLY RECYCLES THREADS, REDUCING THE OVERHEAD OF CREATING NEW THREADS FOR EVERY CONNECTED USER.
